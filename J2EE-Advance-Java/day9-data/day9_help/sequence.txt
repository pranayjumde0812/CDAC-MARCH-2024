Revise first !
@MappedSuperclass
@OneToMany (mappedBy=".....")


Objectives 

For adding a post to the category
Did we have to explicitly save (session.persist) the post ? 

1. Enter Cascading
Observe before cascading n after cascading
--rec was NOT inserted even after adding the cascading
Problem -- The bi dir asso betweet Category 1<---->* Post
wasn't established.

2. What is the correct way of establishing bi dir relationship ?
Use Helper methods in the entities layer.(refer - advanced hibernate sequence)
eg : In Category class , add 2 helper methods
for adding a blog n then for removing a blog.


3. Test cascade on delete 
Delete category details
i/p category id
o/p : a mesg
What will happen if you use this ?
String jpql="delete from Category c where c.id=:id";
Result - SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: since casacding DOES take place if you use update | delete in JPQL
Correct option
get category from it's id (session.get) --> session.delete


4. Get category details 
i/p category name
4.1 Display category details
4.2 Display post details belonging to that category.
Observation ?????

5. Problem root cause n solution for LazyInitializationException
Refer - Advanced hibernate sequence

6. Observe the select queries .
Why so many n any way to reduce ?
i.e Along with Category , Post ,hibernate was lifting blogger(user) details also
Reason -Def fetch type for @ManyToOne -EAGER
So changed to lazy !

6.5 Lab work 
Write a tester to get complete object graph
i/p -- category name
o/p - category , posts , authors

6.6  Lab work
Delete a post from the specific category
i/p - category name , post title
o/p mesg

7. one-one uni directional association between User n Address
User 1-->1 Address
How will you configure ?
Will you use cascading ?

7.1 Assign user address
i/p -- adress details + user id

7.2 Lab work
Get user details along with it's address
i/p - user email
o/p -- user +adress detail


7.3 List all user names from a specified city
i/p city name
o/p -- list of users(names)
8. Till Now , we were looking at association(HAS-A) relationship between multiple entities.
Entities have a standalone existence(typically a separate table) , it's own PK.
It's life cycle(transient, persistent,detached,removed) is independent of any other entity

So this represents : weak association (aggregation)

Can there be a strong association between hibernate managed POJOs ? YES

9. Enter value types
Refer - "day9_help\readmes\Entity Vs Value Types.txt"
Refer - "day9_help\diagrams\JPA-Hibernate-POJO-Types.png"

User HAS-A Adhar Card : demo of entity n value type (composite)

User HAS-A PaymentCard (can have multiple credit/debit cards) : Collection of embeddable

User HAS-A Skill : string (can have multiple skills eg : java,python,react...)
: collection of basic value type


Adhar Card : embeddable : @Embeddable
field : cardNo , date , loc

Lab work 
Link adhaar card n languages
i/p card details , languages n  user id
o/p mesg

10. post n tags

11. post n comment lab work

12. get vs load


13. Port JDBC DAO based web app to hibernate
Online voting - admin part


Optional work 
hands on adding comments 
post n tags --many to many

Enter spring
